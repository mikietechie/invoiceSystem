#	ReactJS and Python django invoicing system

NB please note that for the frontend i.e React app to successfully connect with the backend i.e this projects django app you first have to make sure that the value of the object  *Constants.serversideUR*L in 'clientside/src/services/constants' should match the value of your backends server baseURL. The default value is *http://localhost:8000*.
